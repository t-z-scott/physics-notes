Welcome to my Physics notes! This website was created off my Physics 2002 notes from my Obsidian repository. Physics 2 was difficult for me, so I decided to post these in a way that people can access easily.

The textbook for this class was "Cutnell and Johnson Physics, 12th edition" by Young and Stadler. Credit for the slides goes to Dr. Nadra Sakr.
