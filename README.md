# physics-notes
A website to display my Physics 2 notes, for fellow struggling students. Created with the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden).

> [!WARNING]
> These notes were created for *me* to read and review. I have no current plans to update them in the future.

If a page is not understandable or readable to you, I hope you still get use out of seeing how all these topics connect.
## Generated Website Code
The generated code for the website displayed at https://physics-notes.vercel.app/ is in the `main` branch. The Vercel deployment can be found [here](https://vercel.com/taylors-projects-7d682aed/physics-notes).
